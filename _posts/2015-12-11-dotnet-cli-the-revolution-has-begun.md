What a year! This time last year Microsoft announced the open sourcing of asp.net, and for me was the begining of a new love afair with the New Microsoft. I was at the Tech Decoded conference in London and I remember that for the first time as long as I can remember, #microsoft #dotnet  and #aspnet were trending on twitter.  

One year on, and so much has happened in the Microsoft landscape. Visual Studio Code came out of nowhere - I use it almost exclusivelly now - even for Java development. The Microsot Surface Book is an impressive piece of hardware and I still can't decide if I want the fashionable and trendy Microsoft Book laptop with the impressive tactile keyboard, or to go more streamline and go for the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.

and I have just cloned a work in progress fork of the dotnet cli. Let's have a look.
